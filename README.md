  A course project for React JS training: An app that helps you decide what to pack for your travels.

## 👍 My Challenges:

- Tailwind CSS has been applied.
- Improving the front-end design
- The delete button is disabled when the "Packed" option is selected.
- If the same word is entered, ignore the difference between uppercase and lowercase letters.
- The input Value is trimmed to avoid adding items with only whitespace.
- Some SVG icons were added as imported assets.

## 🎉 Build With:
